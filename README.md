# WITS
A complete socialmedia site with functionality to login, make posts, make edits, add comments, view profile pages and scroll through a social mediate feed.
The website is built using PHP and a private API from the web-development course at Roskilde University.
The site is only accessable to students at Roskilde University, since it is hosted on that network.

The website can be improved in a few ways, but due to time contraints werent implemented.
- Add checks to see if comments still exists before deletion (tests with multi-user functionality)
- Add cleaner solution to hide/show features available to logged-in users
